All cards are tagged with the acronym of the source material, so for example, you can search `tag:HSoB` to look up all cards from Holow Song of Birds.

Some more tags:
- `tag:game`: Source material is from an actual fangame.
- `tag:album`: Source material is from a fake fangame album.
- `tag:hifuu`: Source material is from a hifuu album.
- `tag:concept`: Source material is from a fake fangame concept.
- `tag:music`: Card name references a music track.
- `tag:finalboss`: Card is related to a final boss character.
- `tag:canon`: Card represents the fangame appearance of a canon character.
- `tag:kaisendo`: Source material is from a kaisendo game/album/event.
- `tag:original`: Character is a one-off and not part of some greater work.

Final Boss Medley I made back in 2022. 

Sorta gives you an idea of the rabbit hole that is the Touhou danmaku fangames / fake fangame album scene.

I submitted this set to the mse discord's Field Test season 7!

I also recorded all my games during field test. It's not very watchable though because it suffers from all the standard "Ricky stutters a lot and sucks at commentary" problems. I think I'm mostly recording for archival purposes anyways.

If you do decide to watch it, I recommend watching on 2x speed.

I submitted this set to the mse discord's Field Test season 8!
This time, Rachel's 2HU set was also submitted!
So we can finally play the two sets together like they were some sort of Touhou block constructed.

I mostly built decks using only cards from the two Touhou sets, but I did build with other sets a few times.
Someone else submitted a [Universes Beyond: RPG Maker](https://supergb-denny.github.io/previews/RPGM) set, which I was quite a fan of, so that was one of the other sets I built with more often.

I also recorded all my games this time. Again, It's not very watchable because it suffers from all the standard "Ricky stutters a lot and sucks at commentary" problems.

If you do decide to watch it, I recommend watching on 2x speed.
